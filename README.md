# Employee Record Management System using Linked Lists

### Overview
For my individual project in a Data Structure course, I implemented an Employee Record Management System using a linked list data structure. It’s designed to manage employee records for an organization with functionalities to insert, delete, update, and display employee details. 

### The System Features

 • Insert Employee Record
 
 • Delete Employee Record

 • Update Employee Record

 • Show Employee Details

 • Search for an Employee

 • Update Salary: Automatically add 2% of the salary for every extra hour. By default, 32 hours are required for every employee. 

### Each employee record contains:

 
 • Name of Employee
 
 • ID of Employee
 
 • First Day of Work
 
 • Phone Number
 
 • Address
 
 • Work Hours
 
 • Salary
